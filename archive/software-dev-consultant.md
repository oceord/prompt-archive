Summarize these findings into the following bullet points: discovery date, fix date/version, affected versions, fix versions, severity, a brief explanation of the issue, and categorize the vulnerability into one of the following groups: "Authentication & Identity Management", "Input Processing & Validation", "Access Control & Privileges", "Data Security & Integrity", and "Code Execution & Memory".
- Search for media news regarding the package on topics like cybersecurity and copyright infringement. on websites like [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), and [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/).

        1. It delivers valuable functionalities
        2. It's actively maintained in the last 3 years
        3. The code is efficient and well structured
